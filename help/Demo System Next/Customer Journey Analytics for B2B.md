## Introduction

A complete marketing strategy for a B2B company is a complex melding of account and person-based marketing. Learn how CJA can help B2B organizations gain a greater understanding of their customers, content, marketing and more to acquire more leads, close more deals, and reduce ad spend.

This demo is intended to easily highlight the value proposition of CJA for B2B organizations across several important use cases.

- B2B KPIs
- Multi-Channel Reporting
- Lead Acquisition
- Product Performance
- Marketing Lifecycle & Attribution
- Customer Lifetime Values & Propensity Scoring
- Person-Based Marketing

## Setup

Before starting your demo, open the Bodea: CJA for B2B dashboard in Adobe Demo System Shared in your browser. Then go to Project > Save As and give it a new name so that you have your own copy. This will allow you to execute use cases that require light, on-the-fly editing of the dashboard.

## Demo Talk Track – B2B Analysis & KPIs

- **Talk Track**

  A complete marketing strategy for a B2B company can be complex because you are fundamentally operating on two levels – account and person-based marketing.  To gain a full understanding, you need to have unified people and account profiles.  Knowing and understanding an individual lead isn’t enough.  You need to understand the larger account and opportunity context.  You need to understand each individual’s role within a buying group.  This understanding comes from breaking down your data siloes and stitching together customer data from across systems and departments.  You also need to understand the customer lifecycle and learn how to shorten your sales cycles.  You need a holistic understanding of customer lifetime value and propensity.  Journey intelligence comes from actionable insights that help you understand exactly how your customers are progressing through their lifecycle, what’s working and what isn’t, and identify adjustments needed to improve their experience.  Adobe can help!



  We’ll start with some general use cases, and then dive more deeply into some complex problems that Customer Journey Analytics can help you solve.

  **Click Path**

  Click **B2B Overview**
- ![](../../assets/qW3sKpasACDOtdzL6jt5L_image.png)

* **Talk Track**

  This first panel gives us a high-level overview of our organization.  We can start by looking at how often people are engaging with the organization, merging all online and offline channels. CJA's strength is that it can combine information from any channel into a single view.  This means that when we are looking at events, for example, it is a measure of all interactions with the organization, whether through the call center, at a showroom, online or in the app.  People is a count of the distinct number of person IDs. This metric de-duplicates people across devices based on a Person Identifier, which could be a CRM ID, phone number, or any other unique ID your organization uses to identify customers, allowing us to count people instead of browsers.   We often refer to this as the Golden ID.

  **Click Path**

  Scroll down to **Trended Revenue**
* ![](../../assets/uCgXA4JmVgLCGAHuzitAy_image.png)

- **Talk Track**

  Next, we’ll look at Trended Revenue – the amount of revenue collected over time.  I’ve added Intelligent Captions to this visualization, which automatically summarizes the important points about this report in natural language.  These insights are entirely AI-generated.

  **Click Path**

  Scroll down to the **Engagement & Revenue by Account visualization**.
- ![](../../assets/1e-Q2r123wTtDW2m6acvQ_image.png)

* **Talk Track**

  We can also use our Person ID as part of a lookup dataset so that we can import customer attribute data.  This allows us to associate the Person ID with a company.  That lets us know how many people from each of these companies have visited, how many sessions they’ve generated and how much revenue they brought in.

  **Click Path**

  Scroll down to the **Account Drilldown **table.
* ![](../../assets/FRd0dJ5GMIWSqJr8hTJ_Y_image.png)

- **Talk Track**

  That dataset also allows us to associate that company with additional data like its industry and revenue range.

  **Click Path**

  Scroll down to the **Campaign Performance Visualization.**
- ![](../../assets/Fi58P2uoA5mt5doPbiaML_image.png)

* **Talk Track**

  We can also pull in pre-click Campaign data, like the number of campaigns sent, opened, bounced, and subscribed to view alongside information like people, events, or total revenue. We can also include campaign cost data, so that we can see not just how many leads or opportunities closed each generated, but how much it cost to do so.

  **Click Path **

  Scroll down to **Campaign Revenue, Ad Spend & ROAS**
* ![](../../assets/RY7LsT8JbCHWiEz_vQ6n5_image.png)

- **Talk Track**

  It's important to look at campaign performance, both by revenue and by cost.  The amount of ad spend on a campaign can substantially eat into the profits it generates.  This visualization is showing us the revenue generated by campaign, the total cost of those campaigns, and the revenue after campaign costs (ROAS or Return on Ad Spend).

  **Click Path **

  Scroll down to **Campaign Flow**
- ![](../../assets/8EDxuD6UC4BQsZKXxCpdv_image.png)

* **Talk Track**

  Customers will often interact with more than one campaign.  This shows you the flow between campaign touch points.

  **Click Path**

  &#x20;Expand **Multi-Channel Reporting**
* ![](../../assets/IV53KifFPnKsuqQM3rU6P_image.png)

## **Demo Talk Track – Multi-Channel Reporting**

- **Talk Track**

  One of CJA’s biggest strengths is that it can combine data from many sources. In this panel we can see data from the whole organization in context. For example, here we can see the number of events, sessions, and people by interaction channel, as well as our audience size by data source.&#x20;

  **Click Path**

  Scroll down to **Revenue by Channel and Trended Revenue**
- ![](../../assets/DpUqI6TuQzlYpmdWv5gev_image.png)

* **Talk Track**

  We can compare the revenue that each channel is generating, and even pull in email and survey KPIs.

  **Click Path **

  Scroll down to **Content Performance**
* ![](../../assets/drhrEeruadict_KA23O-R_image.png)

- **Talk Track**

  Next, we’ll add in content performance visualizations. All of this helps us break down data silos to gain a complete, holistic view of our organization.

  **Click Path **

  Expand **Lead Acquisition**
- ![](../../assets/wMC-5iMbH-4t4ex86onzF_image.png)

## **Demo Talk Track – Lead Acquisition**

- **Talk Track**

  Lead generation is critical to B2B companies.  This panel gives them the tools to explore it.  We start by finding out how many lead forms have been filled out, how many leads have been contacted, and then move on the most important question – how many of those leads were converted to opportunities.  &#x20;

  **Click Path**

  Scroll down to the **Marketing Channel Grid**
- ![](../../assets/mtCB74lZZiXv6q8vHNc0F_image.png)

* **Talk Track**

  Since we’re collecting information about what industry our users belong to, we can also easily filter the information about our leads by industry.  Let’s see how easy it is to create a drop-down filter that will show us how many leads we have by industry.

  **Click Path**

  In the search box, type “Bodea: Industry”

  **Click Path**

  Click **Media & Entertainment**
* ![](../../assets/F14xWoBxGcZuw4_S0Z_MV_image.png)

- **Talk Track**

  This shows us the sub-set of leads from the Media industry.  We can also see which campaigns and channels generate the most leads for that industry.  For now, I’ll remove the filter so we can see all our data.

  **Click Path**

  Click the **Industry** drop-down

  **Click Path**

  Scroll down to **Marketing Channel Grid**
- ![](../../assets/5wQ5_hH270ZzNGKMBPMUZ_image.png)

* **Talk Track**

  We also will want to know which campaigns and channels are driving leads so that we know where to focus our marketing efforts, as well as which industries those leads belong to.

  **Click Path**

  Scroll down to **Which sources are driving leads?**
* ![](../../assets/OlT-i5FMem_3D9hkF6AJJ_image.png)

  We also will want to know which campaigns and channels are driving leads so that we know where to focus our marketing efforts, as well as which industries those leads belong to.

  **Click Path**

  Scroll down to **Which sources are driving leads?**
- ![](../../assets/7WSjJTjOIG4EO18ZVeOxU_image.png)

* **Talk Track**

  With CJA we can go beyond which campaigns are driving leads, we can also evaluate which sources are generating leads, across both on and offline channels.  We are no longer restricted to just which online campaign drove someone to complete the form, we can go back and see what the original source of the lead was, even if that source was a trade show or a phone call.

  **Click Path**

  Scroll down to **Top Service Categories by Leads**
* ![](../../assets/Kr936LbxOQVm2A_1qWPXM_image.png)

- **Talk Track**

  Here we can see which services and service categories were driving the most leads.  Let’s drill down a little further.

  **Click Path**

  Scroll down to **Top 5 Services by Detail Views**
- ![](../../assets/SmRZI2pMnkM3YygjKzUr0_image.png)

* **Talk Track**

  Here I’ve broken out the service categories by industry, account, and company revenue range.  Let’s see how we can create a filter on people in the Retail industry who are interested in Risk & Financial Advisory consulting.  Without leaving the main report, I can simply select both dimension items I am interested in: Risk & Financial Advisory and Retail.

  **Click Path**

  Hold down CTRL (CMD on a Mac) and select **Risk & Financial Advisory ***and ***Retail**.
* ![](../../assets/M0CwE2PzGbb4wLVZ5Aymy_image.png)

- **Talk Track**

  Then right-click on one of the selected items.

  **Click Path**

  Right click next to **Retail**
- ![](../../assets/HSzo1M6tbKglGtN_x1C0M_image.png)

* **Talk Track**

  And select “Create filter from selection” from the popup menu.

  **Click Path**

  Scroll to the bottom of the menu and click **Create audience from selection**
* ![](../../assets/xsXQAxEZiaaXTF49Kpw-e_image.png)

- **Talk Track**

  This brings up the filter builder with a filter created.  The filter includes people with the service category of Risk & Financial Advisory and an industry of retail.  Once I save it, I can use it in future analyses, or create an audience from it for use by other Adobe products for targeting or messaging.

  **Click Path**

  Scroll down to **Lead Form Performance**
* ![](../../assets/zxjziDtB_RsqBRyAZDU9y_image.png)

- **Talk Track**

  Lead forms are of critical importance to a B2B organization, so you may be running several versions of the lead generation form.  Here you can see which forms are performing better, and which forms, or versions of forms, are generating the most input errors.  Those are barriers to conversion which could be eliminated.

  **Click Path**

  Scroll down to **Lead Fallout**
- ![](../../assets/aRw4yhOXHB8XFmQkgNUJg_image.png)

* **Talk Track**

  Next, we’ll examine the lead generation process in a little more detail, seeing where people are falling out of the funnel.  This report shows us how many people made it from one stage of the lead generation process to the next.  You can use this to identify areas of friction.

  **Click Path**

  Expand **Marketing Lifecycle & Attribution**
* ![](../../assets/RvbukIhHwrFUWY_Ro-204_image.png)

## Demo Talk Track - Marketing Lifecycle & Attribution

- **Talk Track**

  Now let’s get into some more depth with our marketing.  Analytics previously had a transactional focus.  It told you what happened before someone bought something, and discover what campaigns let to that purchase, or a subscription sign-up, and which campaigns paid for it.  Now we’re expanding our perspective on our users.  Instead of a transactional view, we’re understanding the life cycle of their interactions with our company because we’re tying them to a person ID.  This helps us do things like tie a marketing campaign to a closed-booked deal, something that we can only do because we are incorporating data from multiple sources into that person ID.  Now we can know what different devices they’re using, and the different methods of communicating with our company.  These things are giving us not just more channels of data, but the opportunity to understand what the user’s interactions are over a much longer period – something we would have lost sight of if we were relying on the persistence of Experience Cloud IDs.

  **Click Path**

  Scroll down to **Marketing Lifecycle**
- ![](../../assets/AF3hPkgTLilF0CKz4d9eH_image.png)

* **Talk Track**

  Marketing lifecycle is an aspect of this; understanding which campaigns, marketing channels, and creatives are best for acquiring new users into the system, which are better at closing sales, and which are best for nurturing.  Let’s look at our lifecycle index analysis.  The Lifecycle Index compares the first touch attribution model to the last touch and develops a ratio using calculated metrics. The more positive a number is, the better that dimension value is at acquiring new customers, and the more negative a number is, the better that dimension value is at closing sales.  The ones in between might have dual purposes, like nurturing.  This shows that within a single visualization, we can measure the impact of these channels using multiple attribution models.  You can see how people respond to different marketing channels and different interaction channels, telling you things like whether email or social is better for acquisition, as measured using a first-touch attribution model, or for conversion, as measured using a last-touch model.&#x20;

  **Click Path**

  Scroll down to **Cross-Channel Engagement**
* ![](../../assets/AjldxP2lESm39z1XsH5xt_image.png)

- **Talk Track**

  Next, let’s look at our cross-channel sessions.  These are sessions where somebody interacted with the organization across more than one channel.  These sessions are qualitatively more valuable than single channel visits.  The indicate that a user is taking more than passive effort, by moving from one channel to another, or using multiple channels simultaneously.  Success scoring for these sessions could focus on a calculation of page depth, product sales, soft conversions, and engagement with content highly correlated to late-stage lifecycle.

  We can also examine our conversion metrics by campaign names.  Campaigns designed for prompting conversions may not be the last clicked campaign before a conversion.  Time decay can sometimes be beneficial for picking up more comprehensive conversion indicators for a given dimension.

  **Click Path**

  Scroll down to **Marketing Channel Overlap**
- ![](../../assets/zjsV_K6tM2Fw5QhGZQT8d_image.png)

* **Talk Track**

  In this visualization we are looking at the overlap between our marketing channels.  You can see that we have a relatively even distribution between email, text and social campaigns.  We can even isolate audiences that overlap.

  **Click Path**

  Right-click the center of the **Venn diagram**, where the channels overlap
* ![](../../assets/6aY6slE4DRV16MoBNWdYN_image.png)

- **Talk Track**

  This would allow us to do an integrated campaign across all the channels where users are engaging with us.

  **Click Path**

  Expand “**Advanced Attribution via Adobe Mix Modeler**”
- ![](../../assets/Q47spjmW7zQEoyzMTmlp1_image.png)

* **Talk Track**

  We’ve already done some nuanced marketing attribution analysis, but let’s see what happens when we bring in data from another Adobe product, Adobe Mix Modeler.   These visualizations answer more in-depth questions about attribution.  How did these different channels contribute to an outcome, and what is their incremental lift over baseline?  In other words, somebody who clicked on an SMS message might have bought anyways.  How do we know that click through was an incremental sale on top of what would have occurred naturally?

  **Click Path**

  Scroll down to **Marketing Channel Overlap – AMM Score Influenced**
* ![](../../assets/PScDmgk6gEo2Djj_bUTvi_image.png)

- **Talk Track**

  In this example, we’ve created algorithmic scores that help us understand which campaigns influenced the final sale and which provided incremental lift.  These scores show us the chance that something was an incremental sale on top of what would have occurred naturally.  You can see that the overlap looks a lot different than it did above.  This is because we’re not looking at what drove the sessions – we’re looking at how these different channels contribute to an outcome and what was their lift over baseline.  This is important because otherwise, we are going to be misallocating marketing budget. &#x20;

  **Click Path**

  Expand **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) and Propensity**
- ![](../../assets/H45p-sZhI0ReAjlj2NPSO_image.png)

* **Talk Track**

  Next, we want to understand customer lifetime values and propensity, and how we can drive somebody to move from one category to the next.  We’ll start by looking at the CLTV score broken down by propensity to buy.  This shows us our distinct user groups. &#x20;

  **Click Path**

  Scroll down to **CLTV Upgrades Trended**
* ![](../../assets/6qqiesxlSKM7zGhyLk8AB_image.png)

- **Talk Track**

  But what about the people whose value to us increases over time?  Here I’ve created filters of people whose value has increased from Low to Medium and from Medium to High.  I’ve created a trendline to see how these groups are moving over time.

  **Click Path**

  Scroll down to **CLTV Changes**
- ![](../../assets/cD9rHpcBCN3HEbsx5vINe_image.png)

* **Talk Track**

  Now we can see the people who moved from low to high propensity and value and isolate their behavior – the campaigns, the interactions, the content, and everything that happened with these users so that we can see the places where we’ve been the most successful.  We can use the filter we’ve created to do deeper analysis, or we can create an audience from it to be used in other Adobe products.

  Once we understand that, we can take what we’ve learned from the ones that moved and apply that to the rest of these people who haven’t moved yet and see if we can get more of them to follow that pattern.  And because the Experience Platform accepts data from many platforms, you can get that data from anywhere.  Data that you have outside of Adobe can be imported so that you can run these types of analyses on it.   We can even create new data features out of existing behavioral data that goes beyond just integrating multi-channel data, like using derived fields to concatenate values, or adding marketing campaign classifications.

* ![](../../assets/07ZkHU6HhyJIcnkvRq8hZ_image.png)

## Demo Talk Track - Person Based Marketing

- **Talk Track**

  When we use CJA, we’re looking at data from a person perspective.  For example, one of my attributes is that I work for Adobe.  From a CJA perspective, Adobe is an attribute of me.  To account-based marketing tools, I am an attribute of Adobe.  However, in CJA, information about that account is also associated with me, so we can do things like compare data across industries, based on the industry attribute that is associated with me through my account.  When we see a visualization like trended revenue by industry, we’re thinking about trended revenue associated to people who have various industries as attributes of them.

  **Click Path**

  Scroll down to **Sessions, Leads & Revenue by Job Title**
- ![](../../assets/a6xvJg5GJs6FayYOeyRIU_image.png)

* **Talk Track**

  We can also see more details about the people themselves.  For example, we can see which user titles are generating the most revenue.  I might find that CTOs are one of my top titles that I want to understand better.  If I was doing account-based marketing, I might be looking at the performance of the account, but what I’m trying to understand here is who are the best people that I should be marketing to. &#x20;

  **Click Path**

  Scroll down to **Financial Services CTO Audience**
* ![](../../assets/0ipqgz6w4aR0w1tu3ALTw_image.png)

- **Talk Track**

  We know that CTOs are one of my top user titles, and Finance is one of my top industries.  I want to target these user titles with a message.  To find them, I start by breaking down the industry, financial services by the user title “Chief Technology Officer”.  We can then break it down farther to see exactly which person IDs are in this audience.  As we’ve seen before, I can easily export this group to the Experience Platform to be targeted for nurturing campaigns.

  **Click Path**

  Scroll down to **CTO Acquisition Campaigns**

  &#x20;
- ![](../../assets/18DaeeSwncwWJTb5dEoH7_image.png)

* **Talk Track**

  So now that we know that CTOs are an important title to market to, when I look at my campaigns, I can isolate just the CTOs look at how many leads did I get, who are the CTOs, which campaigns are speaking to them, and what is the marketing cost for these campaigns.  And then I can develop a cost per lead for getting a new CTO. &#x20;

  **Click Path**

  Scroll down to **What is the most popular content for CTOs?**
* ![](../../assets/jkI7-DNMiVGT_1vUEPdCU_image.png)

- **Talk Track**

  Now that I understand what campaigns that are bringing them in, let’s look at what content they’re consuming.  I can see that I’ve got different types of content, and what appeals most to CTOs is Services.  Maybe if I was looking at engineers, their most popular type of content might be publications or some type of schematic.  They’re going to be looking at different types of content because they need different types of information.

  We also want to look at the best nurture cadence for CTOs.  How often should we be sending them messages?  Nurture cadence can tell us not just what the optimal time is to send messages, but what the optimal time is to send messages to one subset of users, specifically.

  **Click Path**

  Scroll down to **Nurturing CTO from Medium to High Propensity**
- ![](../../assets/0hb6UGzIFo6BRBU3T_rG7_image.png)

* **Talk Track**

  What I’m gleaning from all of this is how I can most effectively get to those CTOs.  But that doesn’t answer all my questions because what I really want to do is take these CTOs that I bring in and turn them from being a low propensity to buy, someone who is just sort of clicking through things a little, into a high propensity to buy.  And we don’t just want high-level information, like that they respond better to emails.  We want to know what type of message is the best to approach them with.  Do we want to approach them with brand messages, do we want to approach them with feature messages?  What works best for this group?  Here we might have different lookup datasets applied to our campaigns to understand what they’re focusing on in order to see how we can best nurture these CTOs into a high-propensity position.
