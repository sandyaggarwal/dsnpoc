## Luma Journeys Analysis Report

The new Luma retail journey analysis report allows to demonstrate business analytics capabilities by unifying events from multiple channels like website, mobile, call-centre and in-store customer engagements. Along with data captured from Adobe Journey Optimzer and other external marketing channels, it empowers organizations to measure campaign performance.
