### **Business Objectives**

B2B Marketers are seeing a rise in the number of systems and data points that support their engagement marketing. Within the highly competitive digital marketplace, they need unique messaging strategies that give their sales people the greatest chance at closing opportunities. To support this objective, digital marketers want to leverage knowledge from previously untapped sources to track, resolve, and unify profile details at the person and account level in order to drive differentiated buying cycles with customers.

The following flow shows how Mark and others within the ABC Corporation Buying Group are monitored for progress as they go through the BodeaSecure Trial Experience. Events captured by RT-CDP are used to develop Segments, whose members are then shared with Adobe Marketo Engage as static list members (updated in real-time for steaming segments) to enhance the engagement marketing experience configured by Christina (Bodea Marketing Team).

### **Persona Intro:**

ABC Corporation has seen a rise in machines that are not compliant with the latest Antivirus updates within their organization. To assist with closing the compliance gaps Director of Security Shawna has asked her team to investigate a new solution for distributing and monitoring Antivirus installations across the organization.

Sr. Security Manager Mark, along with Security Analyst Rashid, from Shawna's team have been tasked with researching potential solutions. Together, the three team members make up the Buyer Group that is evaluating improved Antivirus solutions. The following scenario will show how RT-CDP helps track and connect activity within the Buyer Group to align engagement marketing through Marketo Engage. The enhancements will alert the Bodea sales team to key activities within the deal cycle and accelerate the sale to a close through greater access to previously untapped detail.

To begin, Mark and Rashid leave the latest team meeting and with the researching of potential solutions top of mind.
