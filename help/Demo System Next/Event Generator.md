This tool generates AEP events tied to a specified email address. This is useful for filling profile with content for high-level discussion. All events will be contained in a selected Date Range, but the order and content is mostly randomized. This means that if you need to tell a specific story around events, you need to prepare them otherwise.

Event Generator can be accessed through Tools or directly at <https://dsn.adobe.com/tools/event-generator>
