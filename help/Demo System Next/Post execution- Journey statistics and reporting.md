***Buying Group's Statistics-***

Under Specific Account's BG, we can also see the below information like whether or not theyâ€™re qualified for outreach, what they engaged with, and who our top contacts are. And those insights can be accessed in CRM as well.

Lastly, for accounts that have not met my BG's engagement score threshold, we add the people within those accounts to an existing AJO B2B nurture program's journey.
