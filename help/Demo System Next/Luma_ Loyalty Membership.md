### Business Objectives

A good customer loyalty program can help companies to improve sales, increase profits and keep users engaged with the brand. A thought-through, well prepared, and adaptive loyalty program can help attract new customers, keep the existing ones, and drive company profits.

Luma has introduced a new Loyalty Program: Luma+.

### Persona Intro

Alice is 31 years old, a wife and mother living in Los Angeles. She likes yoga, but doesn't have much time to attend classes so she mostly does trainings at home. She also prefers online shopping as she doesn't have much free time.

- At the top of the page, Alice sees an ad about the Luma+ Loyalty Club with the following text: "NEW HERE? Join Luma+ and get 15% discount on your first purchase" She ignores it for now, as Luma is a completely new brand to her.

* She browses the page. After three interactions with the products from women's category, Alice is now a member of the segment "Luma - Women's category Interests." Due to that, the top ribbon updates with a message: "5% discount for all products from Women's category. Use code: 5-OFF."&#x20;

- She goes through the checkout process and wants to create an account but is still not sure if she should join another Loyalty Program, so she leaves the "Join Loyalty Program" checkbox unchecked. She applies the code "5-OFF" and is happy that it works.&#x20;





  Go through the checkout process. Make sure to have the "Create Luma Account" checkbox selected. Do not check "Join Luma+" checkbox. Apply the "5-OFF" discount code.

- Alice proceeds with the purchase process and makes her first order within the Luma Store.

  As a result, she receives two emails. The first one is a registration email; the second one is an email with purchase confirmation. At the bottom of the both emails she sees information about the Luma+ Loyalty Club, its benefits, and the Free Purchase Week. She also learns about special offers for Luma+ Members available in the Luma Mobile App.
