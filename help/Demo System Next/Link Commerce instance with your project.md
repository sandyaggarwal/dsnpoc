You need to set up a DSN project's integration to benefit from Adobe Commerce integration within Demo System Next projects, like importing products and showing product properties loaded directly from your Adobe Commerce / Magento instance.

First, you need to register the Commerce instance that you are an admin of in the DSN (for security reasons). You can do this either yourself following instructions on [Enable your instance for DSN](<../Demo System Next/Enable your instance for DSN.md>), or reach out to Jakub Pelka at pelka\@adobe.com.

Once registered:

- 1. Edit your web project
  2. Open **Integrations **tab and switch to new view if not selected
  3. Find **Commerce **card and click "Configure"

* 4\. In the dialog, select your Commerce instance from drop-down and click **Save.**

  &#x20;If you don't see any options, or it does not pass the verification, your instance hasn't been properly registered in DSN. [Enable your instance for DSN](<../Demo System Next/Enable your instance for DSN.md>) or reach out to the team as mentioned above.

- 5\. After a successful validation your integration is saved to the project. Commerce integration will be validated on each visit to **Integrations **tab. Active integration is indicated by a blue border, as well as instance name and a button to easily navigate to Commerce UI.
