***Prerequisites:***

Before creating BGs, ensure you created 'Roles templates' and 'Solution Interest' under the Buying groups tab.

**Roles Templates**: Journey Optimizer B2B Edition helps us assemble our account data so who we want to sell to is organized and meaningful. In this case, we're saying, " Everyone who has this kind of title belongs to the "Decision Maker" role. Journey Optimizer is going to sift through the data in our audience and put everyone who qualifies for that rule into the Decision Maker bucket. This also gives you visibility and control over who goes where.

**Solution interest**: Journey Optimizer B2B Edition helps us assemble our account data so what we want to sell as a product is organized and meaningful. We are creating a product called 'Bodea-Product X' and linking the role template we created above to this solution interest to define the buyer roles.

Now that we have created the prerequisites to create a BG, click on 'Create buying groups'.

So what we're really assessing when identifying a buying group is:

- Who do we want to sell to
- And what do we want to sell?
