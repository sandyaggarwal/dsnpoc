## What is Audience composition?

Audience composition allows you to createÂ **composition workflows**, where you can combine existing Adobe Experience Platform audiences into a visual canvas and leverage various activities (split, excludeâ€¦) to create new audiences.

Once done, theÂ **resulting audiences**Â are saved and backed into the Adobe Experience Platform along with existing audiences and can beÂ **leveraged in campaigns**Â to target customers.Â [Learn how to work with campaigns](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer/using/campaigns/get-started-with-campaigns.html?lang=en)
