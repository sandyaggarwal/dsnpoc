Demo System Next offers several tailored datasets as well as generators that can be used to prepare data necessary for enhancing your demo scenarios. They are focused on profiles, events and B2B entities - accounts, contacts and activities.

All available assets can be accessed under via main navigation > Tools > Data section highlighted below, or directly at <https://dsn.adobe.com/tools>

Behind the scenes DSN is using Mockaroo Schemas, so if you want to contribute to the data structure, add mising fields or values - contact us.&#x20;

## Tailored Datasets

This section contains two types of assets:

- Golden Profiles - single, rich profiles tailored for particular industry accompanied by carefully orchestrated event history.
- AI datasets - large, up-to-date datasets designed to work with Customer AI and Attribution AI use cases. This may incur increased costs, so consider where it is installed.
