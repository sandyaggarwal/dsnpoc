## Benefits

**Domain** -- The project sits on an ***adobe.com*** domain. This makes it easier for clients to access the page since it's on a **trusted domain**.

**Collaboration** -- You can **collaborate on the project** with other adobe users. This makes it easy for everyone to help pitch in and work together to create a singular client hub.

**Password protection** -- You can secure your project with a password. This makes it more secure when sharing with external clients. &#x20;

**Prebuilt templates** -- Templates help you get up and running quickly. We are constantly improving our designs, animations and layout with CSS to ensure you're able to create beautiful new projects easily and quickly

**Analytics **--* Analytics is now built in. Since this is built on our DSN system that feeds directly into AEP, we can now track the usage of the page via DSN.*
