Code Based Experience is an important way for Luma to deliver right content to its users at the right time. To increase the loyalty program membership, Luma decided to start a campaign promoting its Luma+ program. While using the mobile app, Luma users will be presented with a banner informing peolpe about the membership adventages.

- Chris, Luma user, opens the Luma app his mobile phone. At some point he navigates to the blog page. Along with blogs, he sees an offer on the top that encourages him to be a gold member. He clicks on the offer to see more details.

  The offer content is fetched from AJO.
