# Public Project Luma

We have created an audience in **Adobe Demo System Shared** Org in **Public Project Luma Sandbox **to demonstrate the AJO Reporting for the retail Brand. ([**Luma Reporting Audience**](https://experience.adobe.com/#/@demosystem4/sname\:public-luma/platform/segment/browse/bc287231-9044-4a40-8b9c-d3f0fd461dd0/detail?initialLoad=true\&limit=25\&page=1))

## Journey

We created a journey to target all customers eligible in the above audience. This journey is based on simple logic and used to generate email reporting data and offers metrics for both 24-hour and All Time reports for Luma.
