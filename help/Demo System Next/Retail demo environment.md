   1. You sandbox was just restarted. You need to wait 10 minutes after restert to start the configuration. The reason for this is that after restart some out of the box schemas and datasets needs to be created before sandbox is available to use. Starting configuration too early will cause errors and wont be succesfull.
   2. The merge policy is missing. After sandbox restart a merge policy for profile, enabled on edge should be created automatically. Sometimes this process fails and you need to create the merge policy yourself. To do that go to your sandbox. From the navigation on the left select "Profiles". Next select "Merge Policies" tab. Click the button in top right corner "Create Merge Policy". Type a name, select "Default merge policy" and "Active on Edge Merge Policy" boxes. Save it and restart the quick setup process.2 Core AEP configuration has failed1) Click the Report error button to send the error details to us.
