The purpose of this tutorial is to teach users how to prepare a live presentation/demo/training assets using Adobe Experience Cloud and Demo System Next.&#x20;

You can either follow each step or select the topics that are useful for you and your scenarios. You can always come back and try or learn new things.&#x20;

:::hint{type="info"}
We recommend to get familiar with DSN public projects. More info here: [Public projects](<../Demo System Next/Public projects.md>). Take a look also at DSN [Glossary](<../Demo System Next/Glossary.md>)
:::

For the live presentation on your website, you can use the DSN website templates or a live customer website. We recommend trying both and choosing the one that best fits your needs. Tagging and using customer websites makes a big impression on the site owners but might be a bit too complicated for the new learners. The required step in the tutorial is step 1. It is mandatory to have your sandbox set up and ready with the right data structure. However all remaining steps (3-22) can combine with both approaches. **Don't hesitate to mix and match**.
