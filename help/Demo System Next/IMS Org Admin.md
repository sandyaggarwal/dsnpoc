In order to access IMS Organizations and Experience Platform sandboxes, users need to be granted appropriate access within Demo System Next, separate from actual provisioning inside Adobe Experience Cloud. This means, that each user needs to be assigned to IMS org and sandbox in order to use it in eg. Quick Setup.

There are two primary self-service tools:&#x20;

1. IMS Org Admin - allowing admins to add or update IMS Orgs and integration details
2. [Environment Admin](<../Demo System Next/Environment Admin.md>) - allowing to assign users to orgs and sandboxes to users.

This view lists all the IMS Orgs that you are assigned to in DSN, either as a user or an admin. As a user, you can easily see org details, like ID or Tenant ID. As an admin, you can additionally update these details and set integration used by DSN APIs.

You can also add a new IMS Org using the button in the top-right corner of the table. All fields visible on the screenshot below are required. After adding a new org, remember to update its integration details by clicking the link icon in **Actions** column.
