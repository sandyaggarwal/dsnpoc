## Brand Logos

In order to change logos where applicable, navigate to the edit page. Under the "branding tab", you can see logos that are currently used. The Technical Hub theme has both the Adobe & client logo there. Feel free to change. In order to replace the logo, simply drag the logo from your finder window onto the existing logo. The logo should upload, then replace wherever applicable on the project.

## Stock Images

Some options for stock images include:

(1)

[Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com)

Depending on your org, you should have access to credits and images already pre-licensed. These are great for thumbnails and decorative elements.

(2)

[undraw.co](https://undraw.co)

An open source project to make pre-drawn illustrations easily accessible and available for others to use. Illustrations can also be modified with colors to match brand aesthetics quickly and easily.
