Let's take a minute to better understand what a buying group is.

What makes up the buying group for this company called "Edge Communications" (for example) is all of the people in roles we've identified as important who weigh into the purchasing decision by Bodea. By that we mean, who needs to be at the table when we discuss what you're trying to sell them? That might be roles like:

- A decision maker
- An influencer
- The practitioner (this is the person who will use what you've sold them regularly)
- Maybe an executive stakeholder...

This buying group we've identified has a relationship with what we're trying to sell them. It's called a Solution Interest. In this case, for all Large Companies, we can see we're interested in selling them "Bodea-Product X"

***We can see things like:***

- Who a given person is within a buyer group and what role does they hold
- How engaged they are and what they've engaged with
- How they entered an experience or "journey"&#x20;
- What they'll be sent in the upcoming week
- And, importantly, what other buying groups they might be a part of.
- This is key because, often, a subset of people can be critical stakeholders across many upsell or cross-sell opportunities we're trying to execute. As you can see here, Journey Optimizer B2B Edition can quickly show us who those big key players are.
