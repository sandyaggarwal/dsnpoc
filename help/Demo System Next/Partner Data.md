***Background/Setup Narrative:*** 

- Adobe released the ability to ingest partner data to support full funnel marketing use cases, including prospecting and acquisition  
- These capabilities are crucial to a customer’s ability to expand reach and advertise effectively in the cookieless now 
- Adobe is now able to support the below use cases: 
  - Offsite prospecting for new customers  
  - Enrichment of known audiences  
  - Onsite personalization of unknown visitors  
  - Expanded activation of known customers  
  - Offsite retargeting of unknown visitors is coming soon – GA TBD 
- Partner data is shared or purchased from a trusted partner and that happens outside of Adobe 
  - Examples: prospect list of emails, partner IDs, consumer, purchase or transactional data, demographic, firmographic audiences  
- Enrichment of 1P audiences requires a partnership where the customer shares a 1P file with the data partner, who provides attributes that they’ve found match to the customer’s audience. This also happens outside of Adobe.  

***\*\*IMPORTANT FOR ON-SITE PERSONALIZATION\*\* *****A customer must license and deploy third party visitor recognition technology for this use case to function. Adobe does not operate and deploy any probabilistic identity recognition services. If a customer does not license any visitor recognition technology, or does not plan to, please take that into consideration before demonstrating this use case. ** 

Key themes to enphasize

- Partner data supplements a 1P data strategy  
- This release allows customers to achieve the reality of operating full-funnel strategies in a single system 
- Adobe's partner data support framework is agnostic&#x20;
