**Background/Setup Narrative:** 

- Computed Attributes can be defined in two ways: 
- **Computed Attributes (noun): **Specific values derived using experience event behavior and written to a customers’ unified profile to be used in segmentation and downstream activation.  
- **Computed Attributes (verb): **\[AEP’s ability] To aggregate, sum or count the number of specific events over a pre-determined amount of time and subsequently write that aggregate number, sum or count as a profile attribute within a customers’ unified profile.  
- If your customer meeting is solely focused on computed attributes, the below script assumes some setup has been done from a slideware perspective to orient the customer on what computed attributes is prior to jumping into the demo.  
- If your customer meeting is a double click into RTCDP and you want to highlight computed attributes, you should talk about it when discussing and showing the unified profile.  
- Computed attributes simplify using event level data in segmentation, eliminating the limitations of binary yes/no logic and instead computing values that can be attach to the profile. In other words, customers can now retire granular segment definitions and use a CA 
- The overarching value point of using computed attributes is to enable richer profiles, build more advanced segments and driver deeper personalization opportunities with end customers.
