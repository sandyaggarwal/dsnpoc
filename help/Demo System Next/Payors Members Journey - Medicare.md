### Business Objectives

Payors are facing pressures to evolve customer engagement through a digital-first approach as consumers increasingly research health provider and insurance coverage information online and actively seek digital self-service offerings that meet their needs when they want, where they want.

In response to the demands of increasingly empowered and informed healthcare consumers, payors are looking for ways to deliver improved transparency, preventative wellness programs, and a more collaborative approach to care.

There is a significant opportunity for payers to reduce costs, improve member satisfaction, and improve health outcomes by delivering a seamless omnichannel experience that increases member acquisition and retention.
