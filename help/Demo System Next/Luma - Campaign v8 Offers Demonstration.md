## Offer Eligibility & Criteria

Offer eligibility depends on various **criteria**:

1. A Luma customer.
2. A Luma customer with membership.
3. A Luma customer with interests.
4. A Luma customer with membership and interests.

**Eligibility Scenario**:

1. A Luma customer with **no membership** and** no interests** is eligible to receive a Join Luma + offer.
2. A Luma customer with **membership** and **no interests** is eligible to receive a corresponding Luma + status offer.
3. A Luma customer with **no membership** and **have interests** is eligible to receive a corresponding Luma interest offer.
4. A Luma customer with **membership** and **interests** is eligible to receive a corresponding Luma interest offer.

So, the **highest precedence** is for Interest Offers rather than membership or fallback offer.&#x20;

Also, for each interest offer we have defined weightage if they are a member then the weight will be high or else low.
