Chatbot is yet another way to demonstrate real time data flow between AEP and external system. The chatbot , in this case Sinch, was prepared in a way so it can read and send data from any AEP sandbox.

In Demo System Next there are now 3 chatbot , vertical specific, versions for Retail, FSI and Healthcare. You can find details about the flow using the links mentioned below.&#x20;

Bots are build in a way that allows to send data to any sandbox, without any additional configurations. Each interaction is an bot.interaction event. More details can be found in the event details, botTopic field.
