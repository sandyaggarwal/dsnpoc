Demo System Next Customer Hub can support two use cases

1. **Executive Portal** - An interactive web page that culminates deliverables and work done throughout our engagement.&#x20;
   \* Strategic Partnership Vision Use this document to tell a story of partnership and transformation at the highest level
   \* Executive Alignment & Buy-In Use this document to gain strategic alignment with Adobe and Customer executives
   \* Customer Partnership Summary Provide executive sponsor with tool to share with fellow stakeholders and gain customer c-suite alignment.
2. **Resource Hub** -  a singular hub to share deal information with clients. Centralize conversations on use cases, solutions, overviews, security etc. and include related materials (such as presentations, images, links, recordings etc.) in a single domain.



Both version of projects can be created following these steps: [Creating New Project](<../Demo System Next/Creating New Project.md>)
