Demo System Next allows you to present integrations with bots using Sinch: [<https://app.chatlayer.ai/>](https://stackchat.com/) as an example.

Prepared chatbot flows can be integrated with web projects or external websites.  There is also a possibility to add your own custom bot to your project.

All data gathered with bot are ingested into Adobe Experience Platform and can be used for e.g. segmentation.
