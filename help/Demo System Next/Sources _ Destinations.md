The Bodea website is integrated with AEP, which has Marketo source and destination configured. The Marketo instance (details [here](https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/demosystem/Marketo+Shared+instance+for+Adobe+Demo+System+Shared+org)) is connected to a SalesForce instance. All Accounts, Persona details, and Opportunities are imported directly into AEP.
