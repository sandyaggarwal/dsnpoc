For Customer Hub projects it is recommended to create them via Workspace.

### Shared sandbox

A sandbox in Adobe Experience Platform that is shared usually by a team or group of users with similar interest You can access it by login to the right IMS Org, switching to Experience Platform tool (if you are not already there) and selecting the sandbox from the drop down in the top right corner AEP structure generation is done only once by the first user who will use quick-setup. For the rest of the team, only new Data Collection and Projects will be created with Quick-Setup. (No risk of multiple Datasets) It is up to your team when do you want to reset it It is up to your team what are the best practises in a matter of naming convention, cleaning after a demo etc. It is up to your team who else has access to it



### Private sandbox

A sandbox in Adobe Experience Platform that is used by indivudal working on a demo with active DR You can access it by login to the right IMS Org, switching to Experience Platform tool (if you are notalready there) and selecting the sandbox from the drop down in the top right corner It is up to you only when you want to reset it You don’t have to worry about naming convention to follow It is up to you who you would like to share it with to work on the same opportunity It requires an active DR number to get it From time to time we will check if you still need it, and if yes we will require a new DR number. We recommend to use quick-setup to configure the required AEP data structure. It needs to be done only first time, next time only required Data Collection Properties and projects will be created
