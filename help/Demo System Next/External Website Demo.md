Demo System Next offers a nice and compelling way of presenting demos using the live customer website. It makes a big impact to show the site tagged with Adobe and see all components working using already existing, used every day assets.

:::hint{type="info"}
It is a simulation working only on your own computer, we do not modify the real website.
:::

In the live website demos we are not using the build-in pages that can be created using standard presets in Quick Setup. Each preset marked as external website will work in the below described scenarios. The most important part in this case is the Data Collection property and the Profile Viewer component that will help you tell the story. This demo lets you demonstrate Adobe Experience Platform and other Experience Cloud solutions in the most relevant context without spending any time on finding assets.

Sample scenarios:

- Data ingestion - website sends experience events (product views, add to cart...) and profile data (registration/login form) into AEP
- Segmentation - use events and profile data to create segments
- Triggering journeys - start a journey from a website event
- Web personalization - display personalized offers driven by Target, AJO Web channel or Offer Decisioning
- Server side forwarding - forward data to multiple backends

Please read the [How to set up?]() section to start
