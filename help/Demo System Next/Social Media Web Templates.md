# Introduction

DSN brings you the latest web templates for various social media platforms. The primary objective behind these templates is to give Solutions Consultants more flexibility and connect the personas to the demo storyline.

We have covered templates for the major Social media platforms:

1. [Facebook](https://dsn.adobe.com/docs/web-template-for-facebook)
2. [Instagram](https://dsn.adobe.com/docs/web-template-for-instagram)
3. [LinkedIn](https://dsn.adobe.com/docs/web-template-for-linkedin)

## Objective

As the Solutions Consultants may need to demonstrate in the demo that the customer is arriving from a social media platform by clicking on an offer, we have introduced new social media web templates to address this requirement.
