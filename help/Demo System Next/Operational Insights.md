## What is Operational Insights?

**Operational insights** refer to answers AI Assistant generates about your metadata objects (attributes, audiences, dataflows, datasets, destinations, journeys, schemas, and sources), including counts, lookups, and lineage impact. It does not look at any data within the sandbox. The Operational Insights documentation provides more details[.](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/ai-assistant/home#operational-insights)
