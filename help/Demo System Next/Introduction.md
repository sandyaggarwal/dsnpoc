The power of Journey Optimizer B2B Edition for B2B businesses is its ability to surface critical sales and marketing data that has historically been very difficult to access. What we're looking at here is a snapshot of how our buying groups, or cohorts of account people, are interacting in our pipeline. At a glance, we can see things like:

- How many buying groups are in each stage of our funnel and what is the conversion rate of that group is
- Our top buying groups ranked by their engagement with us
- Which accounts are showing a markedly high amount of engagement activity, including AI-generated summaries of that activity
- And which buying groups have all of the members in them that we need for outreach, and where we might have missing roles that are important to include in the conversation.

And, if we don’t know where to start, you can use Journey Optimizer B2B’s AI assistant at the top of the screen to help you on your way.
