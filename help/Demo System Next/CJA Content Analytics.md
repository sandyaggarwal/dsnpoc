This live CJA workspace is available in Adobe Demo System Shared (part of the Demo System Next ecosystem). You can use it to present Content Analytics (aka Project Condor) to your customers.&#x20;

Content Analytics is a solution for easy analysis of AEM Assets within CJA using AI-generated metadata that provides details from overall tone to image tags to marketing emotion. By using GenAI, we can analyze every asset and provide metadata that describes that asset in different ways. All this metadata has been AI-generated and associated with each asset and each piece of content.&#x20;

With that information, companies can analyze which assets, and what aspects of those assets, are working and which are not. This allows them to justify expenditure on generating and creating assets, as well as allowing them to personalize them by deploying the assets to specific audiences.
